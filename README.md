# AWSInstanceTools

Amazon Web Services Instance Tools lets you simplify using the AWS Powershell Tools to start and stop your AWS EC2 virtual machines.

# Requirements

* Powershell 4.0

# Install

It's easy to install using our install scripts 01 - 03. 

* If you don't have Chocolatey, open `CMD.exe` and run script #1 to install Chocolatey. Once done, open a **brand new Powershell** window as Administrator, instead of `CMD.exe`
* Type `Set-ExecutionPoliciy Unrestricted` to allow running powerful scripts.
* If you don't have Powershell 4, or don't know what version you have, open Powershell as Administrator and run script #2 by typing `./02_install_powershell4.ps1`. This determines if you need to upgrade and uses Chocolatey to install Powershell 4 if you do.
* Finally, run script #3 from Powershell to install PsGet and the AWSInstanceTools themselves.

# Usage
